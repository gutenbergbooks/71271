<p>Bob’s father was dead. He died
when Bob was so young that the
child did not know as he had ever
seen him. Don’t you pity little Bob?
Would not you feel very sorry if
your father should be taken away
and you never see him again?</p>

<p>But Bob had a mother. Yes, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
was she on her last sick bed; all the
long years since his father had died
she had worked hard to get enough
to live on with her little boy through
heat and cold, and wet and dry, till
at last she was worked out, and she
lay down to die.</p>

<p>She had been a good mother to
Bob; she had read the Bible to him,
and told him all about God, and the
good place up in the skies where his
papa had gone, and where she was
going, and where he too would go if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
he were good. And Bob loved his
mother very dearly, and he loved
the Bible and he loved God. A very
good boy was little Bob; but O it
was a sad, sad day to him when his
mother died.</p>

<p>He sat by her side all the time
she was sick, and read to her from
the Bible, and talked with her till
he felt as if his little heart was ready
to break. “Mother, O mother, take
me with you, will you not? What
will become of your little Bob when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
you are gone? I shall have no
place to live in. I would so much
rather die and go to the good place
with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child,” the mother
would say, “it grieves me to the
heart to leave you here, and I cannot
tell where you will go; but the
good Lord will take care of you, and
it will not be long ere you will come
to be with me. Be a very good boy.
Always be ready to do a kind act to
all that come in your way, and you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
will find friends. Come and kiss
me, my boy;” and then the poor
child would lay his head on the bedside
and sob himself to sleep.</p>

<p>The poor woman had a few friends,
but they were as poor as herself, and
had little mouths in their own houses
to feed. But one that lived near by
said that he would take poor Bob
and care for him till he could find
some one else to take him, and so
the poor woman died with a smile
on her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Spring came. The leaves were on
the trees, and the grass was green
on the hill-sides and in the graveyard;
but it had not grown much on
the new made grave, when a place
was found for Bob as cabin-boy on
board of a ship. It was not such a
place as his mother would have
wished for her boy, but it was the
best that could be done then, and
the poor man felt as if he could keep
him no longer. And so he went,
and though his little heart was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
ready to burst with grief, he would
say to himself, “I must do good
and I will get friends, and it is only
a little while till I go to be with my
mother.”</p>

<p>Sailors are a hard set of men.
They were so on the ship where Bob
was. They would swear, and drink,
and fight, and at first they made
fun of poor Bob; but he was so
active, and so ready to learn, and so
willing to do any little thing for
them, that he soon got their goodwill,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
though on the whole he led a
hard life of it.</p>

<p>The captain was a proud, cold,
hard man, and the sailors did not
like him. After a while he was taken
sick, and they would none of
them mind him. They took the
care of the ship into their own
hands, and if the poor sick man crept
out on deck they took no notice of
a word he said. Then he would
swear and rave away at them, and
this made him so much worse that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
at last he was too sick to come out
at all, and none of them went in
to see him, so then he lay very ill
and quite alone.</p>

<p>Little Bob saw all this, but he
hardly knew what to do. The captain
had always been cross to him,
and now he feared he would be
worse than ever. But he felt very
sorry for him, and his mother’s
words came to his mind, “Be kind
to all,” and he said to himself, “I
can but try it anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>So he went very softly to the captain’s
door and tapped with his little
fingers. “Who’s there?” asked the
captain in a very gruff voice. “It’s
little Bob, sir. Can I do anything
for you?”</p>

<p>“Go to your work you little
rascal,” was the angry reply, “and
don’t come here to plague me.”</p>

<p>Little Bob stole away more softly
than he came, but there was no
anger in his heart toward the bad
man. There was pity there, and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
made up his mind that he would go
again the next day. So the brave little
fellow went and tapped again at the
door. “Who’s there?” was the reply.
“Can’t I do something for
you to-day, sir?” asked the little boy.</p>

<p>“No, no; go away,” said the hard-hearted
man. But Bob took notice
that his voice was not so harsh as
it was the day before, and he called
him no harsh names, and he said to
himself, “He will let me in by and
by if I keep on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>He was so sure of this that he
could not wait till the next day, but
he went again toward night. All
the day the captain had thought
over the kind act of little Bob, the
only one of them all that had come
near him; and his hard heart had
begun to melt, and he made up his
mind that if he came again he would
let him come in.</p>

<p>So he was glad to hear that
little tap at his door. “Come in,”
said he, and Bob came in softly on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
tiptoe, and said very gently, “Please,
sir, can I make your bed for you, and
get you a cup of tea? I’ll do it
very nicely and very quickly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, you may do it if you
like.” His little heart beat almost
wild with joy. The bed was soon
made, and away he ran and soon
came back with a little tray on
which was a plate of toast, and a
cup of tea, and some crackers, and
it was so nice that the captain
seemed to like it very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Now Bob always carried his little
Bible that his mother had given him
in his pocket, and as he stood there
by the bedside the captain saw it.</p>

<p>“What book is that?” said he.</p>

<p>“It is a book my mother gave
me, sir,” said Bob, “the nicest book
you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Can you read it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“O yes, sir; my mother taught
me, and I should like to read it to
you if you please, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I don’t care if you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
do. The truth is I’m tired of lying
here alone with nothing to do.
Take away this tray now, I have
done, and then you may read.”</p>

<p>Bob took away the tray, and then
sat down on a box by the bedside
and took out his Bible. He found
one of the places where it tells about
Jesus, how he went about doing
good, how kind he was to the poor,
and the sick, and the lame, and the
blind, and how he healed them and
forgave their sins. He read on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
long time, and the poor man drank
in every word, and when the boy
stopped he asked him to come again
the next day.</p>

<p>After this he was with the captain
almost all the time. He took
the best care of him that he could;
he brought him food and clean
clothes, and kept the room in order,
and, in short, made a very good little
nurse. Still he was more of a
teacher than a nurse, and for long
hours they would sit and talk of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Jesus and the Bible, and how to be
good. Little Bob told him about his
mother, and all that she had taught
him, and all that he had learned at
the Sunday-school. It was a good
thing that Bob had learned so much;
it was a good thing that he did not
forget what he had learned, for he
was now able to tell almost all that
the captain wanted to know.</p>

<p>At last some of the crew began to
wonder what made Bob visit the
cross captain so much, and one came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and put his ear to the door from
day to day and heard some of the
things that were said. Then he
went and told the others, and then
they asked Bob about him, and he
told them that a great change had
come over the captain, and that he
was now very kind and good. So
one by one they got leave through
Bob to come and see him, and they
begged his pardon and he begged
theirs, and they were all friends
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>But the captain did not get well.
He seemed to grow worse and worse
each day, and he told Bob that he
did not think he should live long.</p>

<p>“O then,” said Bob, “you’ll see
my mother, won’t you? and will you
tell her that her Bob is trying to be
a good boy and meet her in heaven?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Bob,” was the reply, while
the tears rolled down the poor man’s
face, “if I am ever so happy as to
get to heaven I shall try to see your
mother, to thank her for myself for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the good that you have done me
through her teaching. Pray for me,
Bob, that I may get there.”</p>

<p>Bob’s little Bible now was the
great comfort of the captain, and he
read it for himself when he was able.
One night he asked Bob to leave it
with him that he might read it when
he was awake in the night, and Bob
did so. Early the next day he went
as he always did and tapped at the
door. There was no reply, and he
tapped again. Still no reply, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
then he walked in. There was the
captain on his knees, with the Bible
lying open on a chair before him.
Bob spoke, but there was no reply.
He came close up, but the captain
did not stir. He put his hands on
him, and then he knew that the captain
was dead. He died on his
knees praying over the Bible. We
trust that through what he learned
of Bob he sought and found the
Saviour and went to heaven.</p>

<p>Happy Bob! How well he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
paid for doing good! Go, little
reader, and do good also. Do good
at all times to all you meet, and the
Lord will bless you.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
